# Dark Forest Frontend

This is an online strategy game that takes inspiration from Stellaris and Liu Cixin's Three Body Problem series. Users may create an account, then create or join a lobby and enter a galactic conquest simulation with their friends/foes.

Players spawn randomly spread across a procedurally generated galaxy. In order to achieve their ambitions of conquest they must first make a move. Players will select an option and under each time interval every player's move will be executed simultaneously server side, then reflected on the client side. Whoever conquers the whole galaxy wins!

Play the game to find out the rest :)

# Dark Forest Backend

I used the Java Spring Boot framework with IntelliJ to build the application server, and I have a database that stores the secure user info.

The backend is closed source as I don't want to expose code that involves user authentication to the public.
